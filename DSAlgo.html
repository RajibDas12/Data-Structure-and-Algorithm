<h1>Basic Data Structure &amp; Algorithms</h1>
<h3>Data Structures :</h3>
<p>Arrangement of data so that they can be used efficiently.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Data Structure and Algorithms are nothing new.If you have done programming in C.</strong></p>
<hr />
<h2>Time Complexity &amp; Big O Notation :</h2>
<p>Time complexity is the structure study of efficiency of algorithms.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Time Complexity = How time taken to execute an algorithms grow with the size of the input.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2>Asymptotic Notation :</h2>
<p>Asymptotic notations gives us an idea about how good a given algorithm is compared to some other algorithms.</p>
<p>Mathematical Definition of "<strong>order of</strong>" now.</p>
<p>Primarily there are three types of widely used asymptotic nonations.</p>
<ol>
<li>Big oh nonation (o)</li>
<li>Big omega notation</li>
<li>Big theta notation</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Which one of these to use ?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since Big theta gives a better picture of runtime for a given algorithm.Most of the interviewers expect you to provide an answer in terms of Big theta when they say "<strong>order of</strong>".</p>
