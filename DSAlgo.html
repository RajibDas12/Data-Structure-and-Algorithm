<h1>Basic Data Structure &amp; Algorithms</h1>
<h3>Data Structures :</h3>
<p>Arrangement of data so that they can be used efficiently.</p>
<h3>Algorithms :</h3>
<p>Sequence of steps on data using efficient data structure to solve a given problem.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Other Tech Terminology :</h2>
<h3>Database :</h3>
<p>Collection of information in permanent storage for faster retreival and updation.</p>
<h3>Data Warehousing :</h3>
<p>Management of huge amount of legacy data for better analysis.</p>
<h3>Big Data :</h3>
<p>Analysis of too large or complex data which can not be dealt with tech traditional data processing application.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Data Structure and Algorithms are nothing new.If you have done programming in C.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have used Arrays -&gt; A data structure have same sequence of processing stps to solve a problem -&gt; Algorithm.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2>Memory Layout of C Programs :</h2>
<p>When the program starts, it's code is copied to the main memory.

Stack holds the memory occupied by the functions.

Heap contains the data which is requested by the program as dynamic memory.

Initialized and uninitialized data segments hold initialized and uninitialized global variables respectively.
</p>

<hr />
<h2>Time Complexity &amp; Big O Notation :</h2>
<p>Time complexity is the structure study of efficiency of algorithms.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Time Complexity = How time taken to execute an algorithms grow with the size of the input.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h2>Asymptotic Notation :</h2>
<p>Asymptotic notations gives us an idea about how good a given algorithm is compared to some other algorithms.</p>
<p>Mathematical Definition of "<strong>order of</strong>" now.</p>
<p>Primarily there are three types of widely used asymptotic nonations.</p>
<ol>
<li>Big oh nonation (o)</li>
<li>Big omega notation</li>
<li>Big theta notation</li>
</ol>
<h3>Big oh notation :</h3>
<p>Big oh notation is used to describe asymptotic upper bound.</p>
<p>Mathematically, if f(n) describes running time of an alforithm; f(n) is O(g(n)) if there exist positive constants C and n0 such that </p>
<blockquote>
<p>O &lt;= f(n) &lt;= c g(n)
......................for all n &gt;= n0</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Big omega notation :</h3>
<p>Just like O notation provides an asymptotic uper bound, omega notation provides asymtotic lower bound.
Let f(n) define running time of an algorithms.</p>
<p>f(n) is said to be omega(g n) if there exists positive constants C and n0 such that </p>
<blockquote>
<p>O &lt;= c g(n) &lt;= f(n).......................for all n &gt;= n0</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Big theta notation :</h3>
<p>Let f(n) define running time of an algorithms.</p>
<p>f(n) is said to be theta(g n) if f(n) is O(g(n)) and f(n) is theta(g(n))</p>
<p>Mathematically,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O &lt;= f(n) &lt;= c1 g(n)</p>
<p>O &lt;= c2 g(n) &lt;= f(n)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Merging both the equations, we get :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O &lt;= c2 g(n) &lt;= f(n) &lt;= c1 g(n)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The equation simply means there exist positive constants c1 and c2 such that f(n) is sanduiched between c2 g(n) and c1 g(n).</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Which one of these to use ?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since Big theta gives a better picture of runtime for a given algorithm.Most of the interviewers expect you to provide an answer in terms of Big theta when they say "<strong>order of</strong>".</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h3>Increasing order of common runtimes :</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>1 &lt; log n &lt; n &lt; n logn &lt; n2 &lt; n3 &lt; 2n &lt; nn</p>
